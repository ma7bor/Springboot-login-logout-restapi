# Springboot-login-logout-restapi

hello dear,
This is a authentication springboot project   using angular for the front-end side .Once you download the files you need to install 
some packages for the angular  from cmd : cd desktop/angular...end , after that use this command npm install and then ng serve -o.
Now the angular server is runing  ,that  all you need now is to run the springboot project and enjoy it !
Note : you might be change the credentials (password & login ) , in order to do that, go to application properties file.
